I'm including this to discuss further ways I could have improved the program, but didn't for
various reasons.

Firstly, I could have had a random bag of marbles, with a random length and random numbers.
This could have been accomplished with a randomizer, though it may have ruined the "uniqueness"
of the marbles, since there could be multiple 1s or 2s. Thus, I could further improve the list by
removing all duplicate ints. However, since I'm writing about how it could work in here, and not 
implementing it, clearly I didn't do this. Why? Because the assignment was to do this as simply as
possible. Making a pre-ordained marble bag is way simpler than doing the above. By a country mile.


And this is the part where I've decided to break off from the above notes to discuss a few things:
Firstly, I'd like to apologize for the severe lateness of this assignment. "I'll have time Sunday"
turned into "Wait, how exactly does C++ work again?", which turned into "Unforseen circumstances on
Monday, so I'll do what I can Tuesday" which became "More unforseen circumstances on Tuesday
(sickness and personal responsibility don't mix well, by the way)" which became "I guess I have to
do it Wednesday" which became "Wednesday night works" which became "F*** it, I'm gonna do it in
Python, because at least then if something else unexpected comes up, at least the assignment will only
take me 30 minutes to do". So the above is the notes I made about the C++ code, and the included 
README is also about that code. There are going to be 2 attached code files, one (not working) in
C++, which is about as far as I got before life happened. The other (working) is in Python, which I'm
doing right after writing this.
